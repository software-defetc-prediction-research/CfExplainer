# CfExplainer
  CfExplainer, a rule-based method for explainable defect prediction
# DataSet
  we selected Openstack and Qt from the open source software projects provided by McIntosh and Kamei(https://github.com/software-rebels/JITMovingTarget)
# CfExplainer Method
  1. Generating synthetic instances
     1.1 Similar Instance Selection: Feature normalisation, Calculate the instance similarity score, Select top-N similar instances
     1.2 Counterfactual generation of synthetic instances
  2. Synthetic Instance Prediction
  3. Building Local Model
     3.1 Rule Generation(Apriori)
     3.2 Rule Ranking
     3.3 Rule Pruning
     3.4 Multi-Rule Prediction
  4. Rules Explanation
# Research Questions
  1. RQ1: How similar are the synthetic instances generated by CfExplainer to the instances to be explained?
  2. RQ2: Does our CfExplainer have higher local model fitness than other baseline methods?
  3. RQ3: How reliable is the CfExplainer explanation?
